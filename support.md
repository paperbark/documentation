# Support
Having issues with something related to PaperBark?
The PaperBark team is available in the GitHub issue section and email.

## SDK issues
When having issues with one of our SDK's the best way to get help is by creating an issue in the GitHub repository of that SDK.
Bugs and suggestions can be created too.

## Documentation issues
If you're having trouble understanding our documentation or there's something wrong with it we would love to receive feedback about it.
The documentation is, just like the sdks, on GitHub and contains an issue tab where you can post your questions/feedback.

## Other issues
When the GitHub issues are not an option or your issue is related to something else you can email us at [support@paperbark.io](mailto:support@paperbark.io).
